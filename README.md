# EquationEye â€“ Handwritten Math Expression Recognition  

EquationEye is an AI-powered OCR model designed to recognize handwritten mathematical expressions with high accuracy. Using deep learning techniques, it processes images of equations and extracts mathematical symbols for further computation.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- **Dataset**: Uses the [Handwritten Math Expressions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/govindaramsriram/handwritten-math-expressions-dataset).  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Converts images to grayscale  
  - Resizes to 128Ã—128 pixels  
  - Normalizes pixel values  
- **Model Architecture**:  
  - **CNN layers** for feature extraction  
  - **LSTM layers** for sequence modeling  
  - Fully connected dense layers for classification  
- **Training & Evaluation**:  
  - Model is trained with Adam optimizer  
  - Categorical cross-entropy loss function  
  - Accuracy & loss tracking over epochs  
  - Confusion matrix for performance evaluation  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The dataset consists of handwritten mathematical expressions with corresponding labels. It includes expressions like:  
```
3 + 4 â†’ 7
(8 - 5) â†’ 3
9 Ã· 3 â†’ 3
```
